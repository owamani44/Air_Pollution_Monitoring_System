**üõ∞Ô∏è Air Pollution Monitoring System with GSM & ThingSpeak**

A real-time IoT-based air quality monitoring system that detects harmful gases in the environment using MQ-series sensors and transmits data via GSM (SIM800L) to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak) for visualization and alerting. This system is designed for deployment in regions affected by pollution to enable accessible, remote air quality monitoring.

**üìñ Overview**

This system continuously monitors air quality using MQ-7 (Carbon Monoxide) and MQ-135 (Air Quality) gas sensors. Sensor data is processed by an Arduino board and transmitted over GSM to ThingSpeak. Users can remotely monitor air quality levels and receive alerts based on thresholds.

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**

Sensors: MQ-7 detects CO; MQ-135 detects harmful gases like NH‚ÇÉ, NO‚Çì, Benzene.

Arduino: Reads analog values from sensors and evaluates pollution level.

Thresholds: If values exceed a defined limit, the system triggers LED/buzzer alerts.

GSM Transmission: Arduino communicates with SIM800L to send data to ThingSpeak.

Cloud Dashboard: ThingSpeak plots data on graphs for remote monitoring.

**üõ† Installation & Setup**

Connect Hardware:

Wire MQ-7 and MQ-135 to analog pins A0 and A1.

Connect SIM800L to TX/RX (via logic level shifter if needed).

Connect buzzer and LED to digital pins.

Power Supply:

Use LM2596 to step down voltage to 4V for SIM800L.

Ensure clean power; SIM800L is sensitive to noise and current drops.

Upload Code:

Open AirPollutionMonitoring.ino in Arduino IDE.

Install required libraries: SoftwareSerial, ThingSpeak, etc.

Add your ThingSpeak channel details and SIM800L APN credentials.

Upload to Arduino.

üåê ThingSpeak Configuration

Create a ThingSpeak account.

Create a new channel and enable fields (e.g., Field1 = CO, Field2 = AQI).

Get your Write API Key.

Replace in Arduino code:

String API = "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY";

üìä Expected Output

Values printed on serial monitor

LED turns on + buzzer sounds when gas concentration exceeds safe limits

Data appears on ThingSpeak graphs

**üß™ Troubleshooting**

Problem and Solution

SIM800L not connecting

Check voltage (must be ~4V), strong signal
If it fails persistently replace the LM2596 with a shockty diode (IN4007 power diode)

GSM not sending data

Confirm APN, API key, network status

Sensors giving wrong readings

Warm up for 1-2 mins; calibrate if needed

Reboots when GSM sends data

Use capacitor (e.g., 1000¬µF) near SIM800L
